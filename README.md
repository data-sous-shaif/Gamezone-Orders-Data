<h3>Strong Growth Trajectory</h3>
<ul>
<li>RPAC grew 65% over two years: from $239 (Jan 2019) to $395 (Dec 2020) — strongest monetization period on record.</li>
<li>December 2020 marked the ceiling at $395 — highest RPAC achieved under current business model.</li>
<li>Current position: $293 (Feb 2021), down 26% from peak but still 23% above Jan 2019 baseline.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Critical Decline Post-Peak</h3>
<ul>
<li>January 2021 RPAC collapsed to $383 (3% below Dec 2020), but masked deeper issue: customer count crashed while high-value buyers remained.</li>
<li>February 2021 shows true weakness: RPAC dropped to $293 (-24% MoM) as customer mix normalized and recovery failed to materialize.</li>
<li>Post-pandemic RPAC compression suggests pricing power erosion, promotional dependency, or product mix deterioration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Seasonal Patterns & Volatility Drivers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Q4 consistently delivers premium RPAC: Nov–Dec 2019 averaged $278, Nov–Dec 2020 averaged $362 (+30% YoY) — holiday spending and gifting drive wallet expansion.</li>
<li>Q1 shows structural RPAC weakness: Jan–Mar averages $20–30 below annual mean both years.</li>
<li>Mid-year stability zone: May–Aug historically stable at $245–$300 range — represents baseline monetization capacity outside seasonal distortions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategic Imperatives — Next 90 Days</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diagnose Feb 2021 RPAC collapse: investigate whether decline driven by discounting, lower-tier SKU shift, reduced basket size, or customer cohort changes.</li>
<li>Rebuild to $320–$340 RPAC by June 2021: requires pricing discipline, bundle optimization, and upsell mechanisms.</li>
<li>Prevent Q4 2021 RPAC degradation: maintain $350+ RPAC during Nov–Dec.</li>
<li>Target: Sustained $330–$350 RPAC by Q4 2021 with controlled ±10% variance and 40%+ contribution from repeat high-value buyers (RPAC >$400).</li>
</ul>
