### 🔄 Retention Crisis: 90% of Customers Never Return

- Only 9.34% of customers make a second purchase
- Average 1.09 orders per customer (essentially one-time buyers)
- ~18,000 customers acquired but never return

**💥 Impact:** Unsustainable growth model dependent on constant new acquisition

### 📉 Severe Revenue Volatility: January Collapse Pattern

- Monthly Active Buyers (MAB) crashes 45-55% every January (3 consecutive years)
  - 2020: -55%
  - 2021: -45%
  - 2022 forecast: -45 to -55% (high probability)
- Monthly revenue swings of ±15-20% are standard
- Q4 dependency: 28% of annual revenue in one quarter

**💥 Impact:** Cash flow stress, operational instability, forecasting difficulty

### ⚠️ Channel Concentration Risk: Over-Reliance on Direct Channel

- 83.5% of revenue from Direct channel (single point of failure)
- Customer Acquisition Efficiency (CAE) declining: 270 → 166 (-39% from peak)
- Effective channel percentage dropped: 80% → 75%
- High-quality channels (Affiliate: $343 RPAC) remain under-scaled

**💥 Impact:** Vulnerable to algorithm changes, competitive pressure, market shifts

## **Monthly Active Buyers Performance**

### **Critical Vulnerability: January Collapse Pattern**
- **January Risk:** MAB crashes **45–55% every January**  
  - **2020:** **-55%**  
  - **2021:** **-45%**
- **Structural Flaw:** Third consecutive year confirms **systemic issue**, not anomaly  
- **January 2022 Forecast:** Expected drop to **450–550 MAB** (**90% confidence**)

### **Peak Performance & Declining Recovery Strength**
- **December 2020 Peak:** Reached **1,361 MAB** — absolute ceiling  
- **Current Position:** **909 MAB (Feb 2021)**  
  - **+128% vs Jan 2019 baseline**  
  - But highly unstable recovery
- **Recovery Momentum:**  
  - **Feb 2021:** **+22.5% MoM**  
  - **Feb 2020:** **+131% MoM**  
  - **Recovery power has fallen 83% YoY**

### **Seasonal Reliability & Secondary Weaknesses**
- **Q4 Growth Engine:** Nov–Dec consistently deliver **+15–20%** growth  
- **October Underperformance:**  
  - **2019:** **-18%**  
  - **2020:** **-22%**  
  - Requires proactive Q4 preparation
- **Volatility:** Stuck at **±30–40% monthly swings** unless structural changes happen

### **Strategic Imperatives — Next 90 Days**
- **Prevent January 2022 Collapse:**  
  - Launch retention firewall by **Nov 2021**  
  - Target: Reduce January decline from **45% → <25%**
- **Build Subscription Base:**  
  - Pilot by **April 2021**  
  - Scale to **270–360 subscribers (30–40% of base)** by June  
  - Cuts volatility to **±15%**
- **Accelerate Recovery:**  
  - Match Feb 2020 momentum (**+131%**)  
  - Target **1,100+ MAB by April 2021**  
  - Current **+22% trajectory** insufficient  
- **Target Outcome:**  
  - **1,200–1,300 sustained MAB** by **Q4 2021**  
  - **<20% monthly variance**  
  - **45–50% repeat rate**
