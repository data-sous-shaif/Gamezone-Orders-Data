## Revenue Per Active Customer (RPAC) Performance

| **Performance Insights** | **Strategic Imperatives** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **1. Strong Growth Trajectory with 2020 Peak Achievement**  <br> - RPAC grew 65% over two years: from $239 (Jan 2019) to $395 (Dec 2020). <br> - Dec 2020 marked the ceiling at $395 — highest RPAC under current business model. <br> - Current position: $293 (Feb 2021), down 26% from peak but 23% above Jan 2019 baseline. | **3. Seasonal Patterns & Volatility Drivers** <br> - Q4 delivers premium RPAC: Nov–Dec 2019 avg $278, Nov–Dec 2020 avg $362 (+30% YoY). <br> - Q1 shows structural weakness: Jan–Mar avg $20–30 below annual mean. <br> - Mid-year stability: May–Aug stable at $245–$300 — baseline monetization outside seasonal distortion. |
| **2. Critical Decline Post-Peak: Recovery Stalling** <br> - Jan 2021 RPAC collapsed to $383 (3% below Dec 2020), but high-value buyers remained. <br> - Feb 2021 RPAC dropped to $293 (-24% MoM) as customer mix normalized. <br> - Post-pandemic RPAC compression: pricing power erosion, promotional dependency, product mix deterioration. | **4. Strategic Imperatives — Next 90 Days** <br> - Diagnose Feb 2021 RPAC collapse: investigate discounting, lower-tier SKU shift, reduced basket size, or cohort changes (by Mar 31). <br> - Rebuild to $320–$340 RPAC by June 2021: pricing discipline, bundle optimization, upsell mechanisms. <br> - Prevent Q4 2021 RPAC degradation: maintain $350+ RPAC; prep premium campaigns by Sept. <br> - Target: sustained $330–$350 RPAC by Q4 2021 with ±10% variance and 40%+ contribution from repeat high-value buyers. |
