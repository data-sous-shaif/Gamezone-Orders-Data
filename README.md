# **Monthly Active Buyers Performance**

## **Critical Vulnerability: January Collapse Pattern**
- January represents existential risk: MAB crashes **45–55% every January** (2020: **-55%**, 2021: **-45%**).
- Third consecutive year confirms structural flaw, not anomaly.
- Without intervention, **January 2022** will drop MAB to **450–550 range** (**90% confidence**).

## **Peak Performance & Declining Recovery Strength**
- December 2020 hit ceiling at **1,361 MAB** — highest point under current model.
- Current position: **909 MAB (Feb 2021)**, up **128% from Jan 2019 baseline** but highly unstable.
- Recovery momentum weakening: Feb 2021 rebounded **+22.5% vs Feb 2020's +131%** — an **83% decline** in recovery power.

## **Seasonal Reliability & Secondary Weaknesses**
- Q4 (Nov–Dec) is the growth engine: averages **+15–20% both years** — most predictable upside.
- October consistently underperforms: **-18% (2019)**, **-22% (2020)** — secondary vulnerability requiring Q4 prep repositioning.
- Volatility persists at **±30–40% monthly swings** without structural changes.

## **Strategic Imperatives — Next 90 Days**
- Prevent **January 2022 collapse**: launch retention firewall by **Nov 2021** (loyalty rewards, payment flexibility, Dec campaigns). Target: reduce decline from **45% to <25%**.
- Build subscription revenue base: pilot by **April 2021**, scale to **270–360 subscribers (30–40% of base) by June**. Creates predictable floor and cuts volatility to **±15%**.
- Accelerate recovery campaigns: match Feb 2020 strength (**+131%**) to hit **1,100+ MAB by April 2021** — current **+22% trajectory** insufficient.
- Target: **1,200–1,300 sustained MAB by Q4 2021** with **<20% monthly variance** and **45–50% repeat rate**.

<div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
<h3><b>Strong Growth Trajectory</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>RPAC Growth:</b> RPAC grew 65% over two years: from $239 (Jan 2019) to $395 (Dec 2020) — strongest monetization period on record.</li>
<li><b>Peak Achievement:</b> December 2020 marked the ceiling at $395 — highest RPAC achieved under current business model.</li>
<li><b>Current Position:</b> Current position: $293 (Feb 2021), down 26% from peak but still 23% above Jan 2019 baseline.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
<h3><b>Critical Decline Post-Peak</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Jan 2021 Collapse:</b> RPAC collapsed to $383 (3% below Dec 2020), but masked deeper issue: customer count crashed while high-value buyers remained.</li>
<li><b>Feb 2021 Weakness:</b> RPAC dropped to $293 (-24% MoM) as customer mix normalized and recovery failed to materialize.</li>
<li><b>Trend Observation:</b> Post-pandemic RPAC compression suggests pricing power erosion, promotional dependency, or product mix deterioration.</li>
</ul>

<div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
<h3><b>Seasonal Patterns & Volatility Drivers</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Q4 Premium RPAC:</b> Nov–Dec 2019 averaged $278, Nov–Dec 2020 averaged $362 (+30% YoY) — holiday spending and gifting drive wallet expansion.</li>
<li><b>Q1 Weakness:</b> Jan–Mar averages $20–30 below annual mean both years.</li>
<li><b>Mid-Year Stability:</b> May–Aug historically stable at $245–$300 range — represents baseline monetization capacity outside seasonal distortions.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
<h3><b>Strategic Imperatives — Next 90 Days</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Diagnose Collapse:</b> Investigate whether decline driven by discounting, lower-tier SKU shift, reduced basket size, or customer cohort changes.</li>
<li><b>Rebuild RPAC:</b> Target $320–$340 RPAC by June 2021: requires pricing discipline, bundle optimization, and upsell mechanisms.</li>
<li><b>Prevent Q4 Degradation:</b> Maintain $350+ RPAC during Nov–Dec.</li>
<li><b>Target Outcome:</b> Sustained $330–$350 RPAC by Q4 2021 with controlled ±10% variance and 40%+ contribution from repeat high-value buyers (RPAC >$400).</li>
</ul>

| **Weakening recovery** | **70%** | 🔴 **High** | Strong Mar–Apr campaigns | 🔥 **High** |
| **Peak maintenance failure** | 60% | 🟠 High | Retention + pricing | 🟡 Medium |
| **October pattern persists** | 80% | 🟡 Medium | October turnaround strategy | 🟡 Medium |
| **Subscription adoption <30%** | 40% | 🟡 Medium | Pilot testing + incentives | 🟡 Medium |
| **Ongoing volatility** | 85% | 🟡 Medium | Subscription model scaling | 🟡 Medium |
