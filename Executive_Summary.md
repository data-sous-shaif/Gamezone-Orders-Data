![Business Snapshot](Images/business%20snapshot.jpg)



<h1 style="text-align: center;">  🚨 Three Critical Findings </h1>

### Finding 1: Retention Crisis — 90% of Customers Never Return
| The Problem | Business Impact | Root Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Only **9.34%** of customers make a second purchase | **Unsustainable growth model:** Must acquire 1,600+ new customers monthly just to maintain revenue | **No post-purchase engagement** (no email sequences, loyalty program, or win-back campaigns) |
| Average **1.09** orders per customer (essentially one-time buyers) | **Fragile unit economics:** LTV ≈ **$93** per customer (vs. $110+ healthy benchmark) | **Product portfolio gaps** (customers buy console, go elsewhere for accessories) |
| ~18,000 customers acquired but lost forever | **Zero buffer:** No repeat revenue to absorb rising acquisition costs or declining RPAC | Possible post-purchase experience issues |
| Orders per customer flat — no improvement over time | **Growth treadmill:** Business runs faster just to stay in place | |

### Finding 2: Severe Revenue Volatility — January Collapse Pattern
| The Problem | Business Impact | Root Causes (Hypotheses) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MAB crashes 45-55% every January** for 3 consecutive years: 2020: -55%, 2021: -45% | **Cash flow crisis:** December peaks, January crashes, payables still due | Inventory depletion (Dec sells out, Jan has stockouts) |
| Monthly revenue swings of **±15-20%** (vs. 5-8% healthy benchmark) | **Operational instability:** Can't forecast staffing, inventory, or spending | Marketing budget cuts (Q4 spend high, Q1 conserve) |
| Q4 dependency: **28%** of annual revenue in one quarter | **Working capital strain:** Over-invest in Q4 inventory, then stuck in Q1 | Consumer behavior (post-holiday fatigue, tax season belt-tightening) |
| Recovery weakening: Feb 2020 +131% MoM → Feb 2021 +22.5% MoM (**83% slower**) | **Forced promotions:** Must liquidate inventory at thin margins | Competitive pressure (Amazon/Best Buy January clearance) |

### Finding 3: Channel Concentration Risk — Over-Reliance on Direct
| The Problem | Business Impact | Root Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **83.5%** of revenue from Direct channel (**single point of failure**) | **Platform vulnerability:** Algorithm changes, policy shifts, or competitive pressure could crater revenue | **Over-investment** in declining Direct channel |
| CAE declining: 270 (Dec peak) → 166 (Feb) = **-39%** efficiency loss | **Rising acquisition costs:** Each channel/dollar produces 39% fewer customers than peak | **Under-investment** in proven Affiliate channel (best RPAC but <4% of mix) |
| Effective channels dropped: 80% → 75% (**25% of channels now underperforming**) | **Channel degradation:** Quarter of channels failing, wasting marketing spend | No pruning of underperforming sub-channels |
| High-quality channels under-scaled: Affiliate (**$343 RPAC**) only **3.6%** of revenue | **Customer quality declining:** Lower CAE suggests worse traffic mix | Possible channel fatigue from Q4 over-saturation |

## **Repeat Purchase Rate  **

![RPR Snapshot](Images/rpr.png)

### Peak Repeat Purchase Rate in Early 2021, Followed by a Collapse
- RPR Peak: **31.24% (Jan 2021)** — highest in the entire timeline  
- Current Position: **0.24% (Feb 2021)**  
  - **-99% vs peak**  
- Two-Year Growth Trend: From **14.8% (Jan 2019)** → **31.24% (Jan 2021)**  
  - **+111% increase before crash**

### Critical Warning: Loyalty System Breakdown
- Severe MoM Collapse: RPR dropped from **31.24% → 0.24%** (-31 points MoM)  
- Underlying Pattern Indicates:  
  - Customer fatigue  
  - Weak retention loops  
  - Failure to sustain post-holiday momentum  
- Volatility Rising: Sharp spikes (19–31%) followed by deep troughs (2–5%)

### Structural Shifts in Customer Repeat Behaviour

## 💵 Pricing & Product Performance

![Product Snapshot](Images/part%202.jpg)
![Product Snapshot](Images/Pareto_Final.png)


### Product Performance: Extreme Concentration and Heavy Revenue Skew
- Top Product Revenue Leader: **27in 4k Gaming Monitor – ₹1.97M (32% of total revenue)**  
- Top 3 Products Combined: **84.8% of total revenue** — dangerously concentrated  
- Long Tail Contribution: Bottom 4 products generate **<2.2%** revenue

### Critical Warning: Revenue Dependency and Portfolio Imbalance
- Heavy reliance on **two console products + one monitor** (PS5 Bundle, Switch, 4K Monitor)  
- Lower-tier products (ABC Class C) contribute **negligible revenue**, reducing portfolio resilience  
- High-value items dominate despite low order counts (e.g., PS5 has only 977 orders but **25.84%** revenue share)

### Structural Shifts in Customer Value Behaviour
- Strong Repeat Performance:  
  - **Acer Nitro Laptop – 11.54% RPR**  
  - **Dell Gaming Mouse – 10.97% RPR**  
  - **PS5 Bundle – 8.44% RPR**  
- Weak Repeat Engagement:  
  - Accessories like **Razer Headset (0%)** and **JBL Quantum (6.51%)** underperform  
- Pricing-driven Segmentation:  
  - High-ticket products show **high revenue-per-order** (₹754–₹1627)  
  - Mass products show **thin margins**, high order volumes, but low retention

### Summary: Portfolio Risk and Revenue Fragility
- Revenue is **clustered at the top**, with Class A items owning nearly the entire business  
- Class C items form **70% of SKUs** but contribute **<4%** revenue  
- Repeat purchase behaviour uneven — strong for premium tech, weak for accessories  
- Overall signal: **Business highly vulnerable to performance swings in top three products**

# Marketing Channel Performance 

![Marketing Snapshot](Images/Marketing%20Channels.png)
![Marketing Snapshot](Images/Marketing_Channel_Final.png)

### Marketing Channels: Extreme Revenue Concentration With Uneven Efficiency
- Direct channel dominates **84.7% of total revenue** and **79.7% of total orders**  
- Email and Affiliate jointly contribute **~13.5% revenue**, acting as secondary support channels  
- Social Media + Unknown together account for **<2% revenue** — negligible commercial impact

### Critical Warning: Over-Dependence on the Direct Channel
- Business is **massively reliant** on a single channel (Direct = ₹5.2M)  
- Any disruption in Direct (SEO, brand recall, CPC inflation, algorithm changes) risks **catastrophic loss**  
- Supporting channels show **high volatility** in growth (Email +20% avg monthly, Affiliate +21%, Social +26%) — but still too small to offset dependency

### Structural Shifts in Channel Efficiency
- Best AOV Performance:  
  - **Affiliate (₹308.5)** and **Unknown (₹294.4)** outperform other channels in value per order  
- Best Revenue per Customer:  
  - Affiliate = **₹343**, Direct = **₹330**, Unknown = **₹319**  
  - Email is weaker at **₹205**, reflecting lower ticket sizes and weaker monetisation
- Repeatability Indicators:  
  - Orders per customer mostly stable (~1.06–1.11 across channels)  
  - Suggests **low stickiness**, low repeat intent, and channel behaviour driven by *first-time acquisition*

### Growth & Platform Behaviour Dynamics
- Strongest Avg Monthly Growth:  
  - **Unknown (+73%)** and **Social (+25.9%)** — unstable but rapidly scaling  
- Email shows **high YoY growth (+244%)** — potentially under-leveraged channel  
- Direct channel CMGR at **+3.52%** — mature, stable, but slower
- Platform split:  
  - Direct generates **99% from website**  
  - Affiliate is **>97% website-driven**  
  - Email also heavily website-led — mobile app is underutilised across all channels

### Summary: Channel Strategy at High Risk of Instability
- **One channel controls ~85% of revenue** → largest structural risk in the business  
- Secondary channels show growth but remain too small to diversify risk  
- High-value users appear across Affiliate & Direct, but Email offers growth runway  
- Overall signal: The business requires **aggressive channel diversification** to reduce revenue fragility and improve long-term scalability

# Country And Regional Performance 

![Marketing Snapshot](Images/Country%20And%20Regional%20Final.png)

## 🎯 Top Three Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: Launch Retention Program (30-Day Implementation)
* **Problem:** 90% one-time buyers = unsustainable growth treadmill
* **Solution:**
    * Post-purchase email sequences: 30-60-90 day nurture (6 touchpoints)
    * Loyalty program: 3-tier point system with 15-20% second-purchase incentive
    * Win-back campaigns: Reactivate 18,000 dormant customers with quarterly offers
* **Target:** Increase repeat rate from **9.34% → 15-18%**
* **Expected Impact:**
    * Revenue: **+$500K-$800K** annually (from same customer base)
    * LTV improvement: $93 → **$110** (**+18%**)
    * Unit economics: LTV:CAC ratio improves from 2.1x → **2.6x** (approaching healthy)

### Priority 2: Build January Revenue Firewall (By November 2021)
* **Problem:** 45-55% MAB collapse every January = cash flow crisis
* **Solution:**
    * Subscription model pilot: "Gamer Essentials Box" ($19-49/month) for recurring revenue
    * Q1 campaign pre-planning: December retention push, "Tax Refund Pre-Sale," financing options
    * Inventory smoothing: Consignment agreements, just-in-time ordering to reduce working capital needs
* **Target:** Reduce January decline from **45% → <25%**
* **Expected Impact:**
    * Q1 revenue: **+$200K-$300K** (vs. baseline January)
    * Cash flow: Reduced ±40% volatility → **±20%** (manageable)
    * Subscription: 1,000-2,000 subscribers = **$450K** annual recurring revenue

### Priority 3: Diversify Channel Mix (90-Day Initiative)
* **Problem:** 83.5% Direct concentration = single point of failure vulnerability
* **Solution:**
    * Scale Affiliate: Recruit 10-15 new affiliates (gaming influencers, tech blogs)
    * Add partnerships: 2-3 new channels (esports teams, gaming communities, tech forums)
    * Optimize Email AOV: Bundle strategy, premium product push ($188 → $240+ AOV)
* **Target:** Reduce Direct from **83.5% → 65-70%**, add 2,500-3,000 customers
* **Expected Impact:**
    * Revenue diversification: **+$400K-$600K** annually
    * Risk reduction: If Direct drops 30%, business retains **8%** more revenue vs. current state
    * CAE recovery: Restore from 166 → **200+** through pruning + scaling quality channels
