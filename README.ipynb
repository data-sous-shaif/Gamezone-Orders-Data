    "## 1. Strong Growth Trajectory with 2020 Peak Achievement\n",
    "- RPAC grew **65% over two years**: from $239 (Jan 2019) to $395 (Dec 2020) — strongest monetization period on record.\n",
    "- **December 2020** marked the ceiling at $395 — highest RPAC achieved under current business model.\n",
    "- **Current position**: $293 (Feb 2021), down 26% from peak but still 23% above Jan 2019 baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Critical Decline Post-Peak: Recovery Stalling\n",
    "- **January 2021** RPAC collapsed to $383 (3% below Dec 2020), but masked deeper issue: customer count crashed while high-value buyers remained.\n",
    "- **February 2021** shows true weakness: RPAC dropped to $293 (-24% MoM) as customer mix normalized and recovery failed to materialize.\n",
    "- **Pattern emerging**: post-pandemic RPAC compression suggests pricing power erosion, promotional dependency, or product mix deterioration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Seasonal Patterns & Volatility Drivers\n",
    "- **Q4 consistently delivers premium RPAC**: Nov–Dec 2019 averaged $278, Nov–Dec 2020 averaged $362 (+30% YoY) — holiday spending and gifting drive wallet expansion.\n",
    "- **Q1 shows structural RPAC weakness**: Jan–Mar averages $20–30 below annual mean both years — budget exhaustion and promotional intensity compress margins.\n",
    "- **Mid-year stability zone**: May–Aug historically stable at $245–$300 range — represents baseline monetization capacity outside seasonal distortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Strategic Imperatives — Next 90 Days\n",
    "- **Diagnose Feb 2021 RPAC collapse**: investigate whether decline driven by discounting, lower-tier SKU shift, reduced basket size, or customer cohort changes. Root cause analysis by March 31.\n",
    "- **Rebuild to $320–$340 RPAC by June 2021**: requires pricing discipline, bundle optimization, and upsell mechanisms. Current $293 trajectory insufficient for H2 2021 targets.\n",
    "- **Prevent Q4 2021 RPAC degradation**: maintain $350+ RPAC during Nov–Dec or risk permanent monetization ceiling compression. Prep premium campaigns by Sept 2021.\n",
    "- **Target**: Sustained $330–$350 RPAC by Q4 2021 with controlled ±10% variance and 40%+ contribution from repeat high-value buyers (RPAC >$400).\n",
